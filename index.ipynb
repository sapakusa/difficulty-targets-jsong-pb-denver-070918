    "# Difficulty Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "Target is a bit hard to work with. We know that this is the number that the hash must be below, but as humans, it's hard to fathom the difference between a 180-bit number and a 190-bit number. The first is a thousand times smaller, but from looking at targets, it's not easy to contextualize.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make different targets easier to compare, the concept of difficulty was born. Essentialy, difficulty is inversely proportional to target to make comparisons easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty on testnet when there haven't been any blocks found in 20 minutes resets to 1. This gives us context for how difficult mainnet is. Generally, the difficulty number can be thought of as how much more difficult mainnet is than testnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the number that gets shown in block explorers and so on as difficulty is a much more intuitive way to understand what's going on in terms of effort required to create a new block."
